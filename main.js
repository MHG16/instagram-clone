// Using the tools you've learned in class, create a responsive image board that allows you 
// to add images and captions via a url. The images that are added to the image board should be 
// saved to tiny pizza server, so that when you reload the page, they are not lost. The form to 
// add an image should properly validate the image URL by at minimum checking for 
// a http:// or https:// prefix and require a non-empty description.

//program will be similar to a Todo list application
//create an array to hold the images with their captions
//push the new items into the array.
